# Testing FastAPI E-commerce Backend with Pytest

To effectively test this FastAPI e-commerce backend with pytest, you should focus on the main functional areas outlined in the project features and structure. Here are the main areas for testing, categorized by functionality:

## üß™ Main Testing Areas

### 1. Authentication and User Management (Auth/Users)

This is critical for security and access control.

*   **Registration and Login:**
    *   Test successful user (customer and admin) registration.
    *   Test successful login with valid credentials (both admin: `admin@ecommerce.com/admin123` and customer: `samuelhoffman@example.com/password123`).
    *   Test login failure with invalid passwords or non-existent emails.
*   **Access Control (Authorization):**
    *   Test that unauthenticated users cannot access protected routes (e.g., creating a product).
    *   Test that a customer cannot access admin-only routes (e.g., updating a coupon).
    *   Test that an admin can access admin-only routes.
*   **Password Hashing:**
    *   While not testing the bcrypt function directly, ensure that a successfully registered user's password can be verified upon login, confirming correct hashing and comparison.

### 2. Product Catalog and Management (CRUD)

Focus on the core data retrieval and manipulation endpoints.

*   **Read (GET):**
    *   Test retrieving the list of all products (with and without pagination/filtering).
    *   Test retrieving a single product by ID.
    *   Test retrieving products by category.
    *   Test retrieving product variants.
*   **Create, Update, Delete (Admin-only):**
    *   Test creating a new product as an authenticated admin.
    *   Test updating an existing product's details.
    *   Test deleting a product.
    *   Ensure that non-admin users (or unauthenticated users) receive an HTTP 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized when trying to modify products.

### 3. Shopping Cart Functionality

Test the persistent nature and state changes of the shopping cart.

*   **Cart Manipulation:**
    *   Test adding an item (and a specific variant) to a customer's cart.
    *   Test updating the quantity of an item in the cart.
    *   Test removing an item from the cart.
    *   Test retrieving the current state of a customer's cart (and verifying the subtotal calculation).
    *   Test edge cases like adding a non-existent product ID.

### 4. Order Processing and Lifecycle

This involves complex state transitions and calculations.

*   **Order Creation:**
    *   Test creating a new order from a populated shopping cart.
    *   Verify the cart is cleared after a successful order.
    *   Verify the order details (total amount, line items) are correctly stored in the database.
*   **Order Retrieval:**
    *   Test a customer retrieving only their own orders.
    *   Test an admin retrieving all orders.
*   **Status Updates (Admin-only):**
    *   Test updating an order status (e.g., from 'Pending' to 'Shipped').

### 5. Reviews and Ratings

Testing user-submitted content endpoints.

*   **Review Submission:**
    *   Test a customer successfully submitting a review and rating for a product they have purchased (if business logic enforces this).
    *   Test the system handles submission failures (e.g., invalid rating scale).
*   **Review Retrieval:**
    *   Test retrieving all reviews for a specific product.

### 6. Promotions and Coupons

Testing the logic for applying discounts.

*   **Coupon Application:**
    *   Test applying a valid, active coupon (e.g., `WELCOME10`) to a cart or during checkout.
    *   Verify that the correct discount is applied to the order total.
*   **Coupon Failure:**
    *   Test applying an expired or non-existent coupon.
    *   Test applying a coupon that has already been used (if it's a single-use code).

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Pytest Implementation Approach

The most important part of the setup is ensuring test isolation using:

*   **Fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`:**
    *   **Test Database:** A fixture (`scope="session"` or `scope="module"`) to create and tear down a clean, temporary PostgreSQL database for testing, often by overriding the SQLAlchemy `get_db` dependency.
    *   **Test Client:** A fixture to provide the FastAPI `TestClient`, ensuring it uses the test database dependency override.
    *   **Authenticated Clients:** Fixtures for `admin_client` and `customer_client` that log in using the seeded data (e.g., `admin@ecommerce.com/admin123`) and return the `TestClient` with the valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, making subsequent tests easy to write.
*   **Seeding Data:** Leverage the existing `seed_database.py` script to populate your test database with the 1,069 realistic records before running tests that depend on specific data (like fetching Order ID 68).
*   **Mocking:** Use the `unittest.mock` library (often imported as `mock`) with pytest to mock external services, especially:
    *   The connection to Supabase/PostgreSQL, if necessary, though integration tests that hit the real database are often preferred for backend testing.
    *   Any external payment gateway API calls.
*   **Parametrization:** Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to efficiently test multiple cases (e.g., testing all HTTP status codes for validation failures, or testing multiple coupon codes).
